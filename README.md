# Evanced Slideshow Config Creator

<p> The Evanced Slideshow is configured with a JSON file. But it can be hard to remember all your event ids and and what goes where; 
thats where the Evanced Slideshow Config Creator comes in.  Enter your library ID into the first screen and the form field is populated with your calendars data. 
Then just pick the fields that you want for your slide show and click submit. The form creates a json file for you that you can use to replace the default one in the Evanced Slideshow.</p>
